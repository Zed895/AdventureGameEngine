# AdventureGameEngine
I share the source code of an adventure game engine I am working on.

It follows the classic design of the genre: you can control the hero by selecting an action button with the mouse then clicking on an item you want to use on the scene.

It saves and load from a Derby database via SQL/JDBC.

Example story, actions are included but since the pictures and sounds the code refers to are not my work they are not included.

Used technologies: Java 11, JavaFX, SQL, Maven.
